# Inspiration

# Overview
The Inspiration around building Star Gazer is to experient and learn C++ while using a tool called PixelGameEngine. What makes this game engine interesting is that it is a standalone file that provides much power in creating a game with c++. This is also the inspiration behind using text editors instead of visual studio IDE. I want to make a barebones MMORPG.

# Build
`make examples`

# Run MMO Example
`./server`
`./mmoEXClient` -> you can run this multiple times to get more and more clients connected to the server

# Run Isometric Example
`./isoEXClient`

# Clean up
`make cleanExamples`
