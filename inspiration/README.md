# Inspiration

# Overview
The Inspiration around building Star Gazer is to experient and learn C++ while using a tool called PixelGameEngine. What makes this game engine interesting is that it is a standalone file that provides much power in creating a game with c++. This is also the inspiration behind using text editors instead of visual studio IDE. I want to make a barebones MMORPG.
